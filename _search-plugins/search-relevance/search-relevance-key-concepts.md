# Key concepts

With Compare Search Results in OpenSearch Dashboards, you can compare results from two queries side by side to determine whether one query produces better results than the other. Using this tool, you can evaluate search quality by experimenting with queries.

For example, you can see how results change when you apply one of the following query changes:

- Weighting fields differently
- Different stemming or lemmatization strategies
- Shingling
